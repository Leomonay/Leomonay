I a Full Stack Developer graduated from soyHenry.com bootcamp, where I learned currently useful technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, React Native, Redux, NodeJS, express, Sequelize, postgreSQL, mongoDB, mssql.

I have pinned some projects that show my skills, like the [Movie Searcher](https://leomonay-movie-searcher.vercel.app/) , and the [HenryDex](https://leomonay-pokedex.vercel.app/), which is a Rest API with both frontend and backend, that also uses an external API.

Other project is an awesome tea e-commerce, called [Te Quiero](https://tequiero.vercel.app/)

I've been working for Tecla Coding Academy as a Teach Assitant and an Evaluation Tutor, and as Test Automation Engineer for Globant, where I learned Java basics, TestNG, Selenium and Appium.

I am currently working as freelancer for a company, and I'm searching for a remote job where I can develop my skills and continue learning.
