I have recently finished Full Stack Developer course at soyHenry.com, where I learned a lot. 
Some of the technologies I enjoy working with include: JavaScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, Sequelize.

The first project we made was a movie searcher React app, which worked with the IMDB api.

Then I made an Individual Project: the HenryDex. This is about an easy pok√©dex that allows searching by name, and shows a detail of the pok√©mon when clicked its name. It's also possible to create a new pokemon and add it to the list.

The final project is an awesome tea e-commerce, called "Te Quiero"

Now I'm searching for a remote job where I can develop my skills and continue learning.
